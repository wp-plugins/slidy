== Description ==

[Slidy](http://www.gungorbudak.com/slidy "Slidy / Responsive jQuery Wordpress Slider") is a reponsive jQuery slider that uses [slick carousel by Ken Wheeler](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/ "slick - the last carousel you'll ever need") and it's fully integrated into Wordpress, so it's possible to add and administer slides via the Dashboard. You just need to set the image that you want to see in Slidy as the featured image in each post. Slides can be categorized and in this way you can have different sliders on your website. With the functionalities slick carousel brings, it is possible to create sliders in different ways, such as having multiple items unlike many sliders. Also, with the wide range of settings, you can customize your slider in various ways such as inifinite looping, mouse dragging, swiping, arrow key navigation etc. You can also add links to the individual slides via Add/Edit Slide interface. The slides are posts at the same time so you can use them as contents but you may have to edit your theme to view slide images. Note that this version doesn't cover all functionalities slick carousel provided but the present functionalities are very sufficent for you to create awesome sliders. Check out [Slidy's screenshots here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/slidy/screenshots/ "Slidy's Screenshots").

The plugin is written in English and has been translated into Turkish by [myself](http:/www.gungorbudak.com/ "Güngör Budak"). You're welcomed if you want to translate it into your language. Use translations.pot, rename it as slidy-LANGCODE.po (e.g. slidy-tr_TR) and open it in Poedit. Translate and save. There should be a MO file created by Poedit. Send PO and MO files to me, then I will add them in the next release.
